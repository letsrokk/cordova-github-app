# Cordova Web Wrap

This app is a light-weight [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) wrapper around a
mobile website. It can be useful to add functionality that only works in apps, like
barcode scanning, to a mobile website. While Cordova does a lot to make this possible,
a polished, well-working app is not yet trivial. This project simplifies that.

Note that it's best to create a [single page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application),
so that the website code only needs to be loaded once. This allows the user to have
fast interaction with the app.

Features:

- Loads the website in an app, safely (inAppBrowser).
- Meant for [single page applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application).
- Works when online, a notice is shown when offline (with a state-machine to track state).
- Opens external links in the system web browser, internal links in the app.
- Website can indicate which links to open in the app.
- Allows scanning a barcode, initiated from the website.
- Works on Android and iOS.

## Build

1. [Install Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/index.html): `npm install -g cordova`
2. [Add platforms](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/index.html#add-platforms): `cordova platform add android` and/or `cordova platform add ios`.
3. [Check (and install) requirements](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/index.html#install-pre-requisites-for-building): `cordova requirements`
4. [Build](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/index.html#build-the-app): `cordova build`

### iOS

On iOS `cordova build ios` may not be enough. After running this, you can open the folder `platforms/ios` in Xcode.
In the warnings shown there are two items about updating build settings. Accept the modifications (ignoring the warning
about uncommited changes), and build it from Xcode.

## Configure

- Change `LANDING_URL` in [`www/js/index.js`](www/js/index.js#L21) to point to your mobile website.
- Update `id`, `name`, `description` and `author` in [`config.xml`](config.xml) ([reference](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/config_ref/)).
- Modify `name`, `displayName`, `description` and `author` in [`package.json`](package.json).
- Edit `title`, `h1` and other texts in [`www/index.html`](www/index.html).

Then build and install.
If you want more beautiful icons (recommended), run

    npm install cordova-icon
    node_modules/.bin/cordova-icon --icon=res/icon.png

To use your own icons, update [`res/icon.png`](res/icon.png) and [`www/img/logo.png`](www/img/logo.png) before doing so.

## State machine

This app uses a state machine ([machina](https://github.com/ifandelse/machina.js)) to keep track of
connection and loading state. The state diagram is as follows:

![state machine diagram](./state_machine.svg)

## Opening external links

External links are opened in the system web browser, internal links in the app.
Which links are internal is determined by `LOCAL_URLS` in [index.js](www/js/index.js#L26),
which is a space-separated list of URLs. All listed links are considered to be internal.
Full URLs are allowed (to allow multiple hosts), as are URLs relative to the
host (and protocol) of `LANDING_URL`, with leading slash. Query string and hash are
not part of the comparison.

For example, if you have a mobile website where you want to open the index, an about
page, and product pages, you could use `/ /about /products/*`. All other
links on your website would be opened in the system web browser.

This attribute can also be set by the website by any element with a `data-app-local-urls`
attribute (so the website can evolve without having to update this setting in the app).

## Barcode scanner

The website can initiate a barcode scan by pointing to the custom url `app://mobile-scan`.
When this link is followed, the barcode scanner is opened. On successful scan, it will return
to the page indicated by the `ret` query string parameter passed that triggered opening the
scanner. This is a [URL template](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_Template) where `{CODE}` is
replaced by the scanned barcode. Links can be relative or absolute.

An example. When following the link in the HTML shown below, a barcode scanner will
be opened, and when barcode `12345` is scanned, the link `http://x.test/scan/12345`
will be opened in the app.

```html
<a href="app://mobile-scan?ret=http%3A%2F%2Fx.test%2Fscan%2F%7BCODE%7D">
  Scan
</a>
```

## Adapating a website for the app

This app shows a mobile website. Most of it would also work in a regular web browser, but
certain features may only make sense when embedded in the app. The barcode-scan feature
comes to mind, and it may be desirable to hide large documentation pages from navigation.

This can easily be done in two ways:
1. _User-Agent_ - the `AppendUserAgent` preference in `config.xml` can be used to modify
  the user-agent. The website can show and hide certain elements based on this.
2. `LANDING_URL` - the app's landing page could include a query parameter or be a specific
  page for the app. It can be useful to pass through the query parameter to links, so that
  any modified navigation remains so in the app.

## Testing on the emulator

To test the barcode scanner with the Android emulator, you can use the following
procedure on Linux (based on [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35526103/2866660)).

```sh
# Check which video devices are available. Use the next number for 'video_nr' and in 'device'.
$ ls /dev/video*
/dev/video0
# Load the loopback video device
$ sudo modprobe v4l2loopback video_nr=1 card_label="mockcam"
# Create virtual webcam out of the image, substitute 'image.png' with your picture.
$ gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=image.png ! pngdec ! imagefreeze ! v4l2sink device=/dev/video1
```

Then launch the emulator with the additional argument `-camera-back webcam1` (use same number
as above). You may want to scale the image to 800x600 if you have a large one. One online
barcode generator is [this one](https://floms.github.io/Open-Barcode/).

## Lodash

The state machine requires [lodash](https://lodash.com/), and to reduce the footprint we
use a custom build (527K to 132K for version 4.17.5). The methods included are just those used
in the [state machine code](www/js/machina.js) plus `debounce` (so if you get missing functions
there after a machina upgrade, check if a missing method is used):

    npm install -g lodash-cli
    lodash -d -o www/js/lodash.custom.js include=apply,defaults,cloneDeep,debounce,difference,each,extend,filter,isPlainObject,merge,transform,without

## Notes

- Opening external links can be improved after [CB-14188](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-14188) is implemented.
- A [custom inAppBrowser](https://github.com/q-m/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/tree/all-features-for-web-wrap) is used that
  supports the `beforeload` event, it can be reverted to the official plugin when
  [CB-14188](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-14188) / [PR #276](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/pull/276)
  is released.
- If the inAppBrowser would support opening external links without messing up the internal inAppBrowser, the
  app-launcher plugin could be removed (see also [CB-13198](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-13198)).
- On iOS, opening the barcode scanner briefly shows a _opening barcode scanner_ screen because of
  [this issue](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner/issues/570) (marked _wontfix_).
